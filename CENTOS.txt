CentOS packaging

This is the process to release KeyExchange as a RPM collection.

It requires a few tools::

    $ yum install rpm-build python26 python26-setuptools gcc python26-devel mysql-devel openldap-devel
    $ easy_install-2.6 virtualenv


Next, call make build to pull dependencies and set up a build environment::

    $ make build
    $ make build_extras

To check that the environment works, make test should not fail::

    $ make test

Now you can create the RPM collection for the project and its dependencies::

    $ make build_ldap
    $ make build_rpms

Once this is over, you will find all rpms rpms/.
